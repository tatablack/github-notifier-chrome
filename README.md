# github-notifier

GitHub Notifier is a browser extension able to receive notifications from a GitHub Listener. Its purpose is to make code reviews easier, by notifying people every time they are mentioned in a commit message, and providing one-click access to the commit diff.
Currently, only commit notifications are supported.

For every commit, it is possible to dismiss the notification, to click on it in order to see the diff (open the GitHub commit page), click the repository name to go the repository home page, and mark the notification as Reviewed.
